# Simple-Video-Analysis-System

A simple deep learning based video analysis system, including a frontend to accept usersâ€™ video and a backend to process the video content and extract the audio. Concretely, three main features have been established in the system:

- Upload video to the system for further processing;

- Perform object detection on the video;

- Extract the audio from the video.

Currently, the system is under development.
