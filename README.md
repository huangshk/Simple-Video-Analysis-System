# Simple-Video-Analysis-System

A simple deep learning based video analysis system, including a frontend to accept usersâ€™ video and a backend to process the video content and extract the audio. Concretely, three main features have been established in the system:

- Upload video to the system for further processing;

- Perform object detection on the video;

- Extract the audio from the video.

The frontend is several static pages, while the backend is based on the Flask framework. Further, the object detection utilize ImageAI which implements a RetinaNet model, while the audio extraction leverage the MoivePy tool.

## Showcase
1. Upload video to the system for further processing.


2. Perform object detection on the video.


3. Extract the audio from the video.

## Requirement
- Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.
- Python 3.7.6.
- Frameworks and tools: TensorFlow 1.13.1, Keras 2.3.1, ImageAI 2.1.5, Flask 1.1.1, MoivePy 1.0.3.
