# Simple Video Analysis System

A simple deep learning based video analysis system, including a frontend to accept usersâ€™ video and a backend to process the video content and extract the audio. Concretely, three main features have been established in the system:

- Upload video to the system for further processing.

- Perform object detection on the video.

- Extract the audio from the video.

The frontend is several static pages, while the backend is based on the Flask framework. Further, the object detection utilize ImageAI which implements a RetinaNet model, while the audio extraction leverages the MoivePy tool. Since the model file is too large to upload to Github, please download it from [RetinaNet](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5) and place it in the folder "/Video_Analysis/models". The system supports both CPU and Nvidia GPU, and the GPU can significantly speed up the processing.

## Showcase
